Exercise 30: Pick Word
This exercise is Part 1 of 3 of the Hangman exercise series.
The other exercises are: Part 2 and Part 3.
In this exercise, the task is to write a function that picks a random word
from a list of words from the SOWPODS dictionary. Download this file and save
it in the same directory as your Python code. This file is Peter Norvigâ€™s
compilation of the dictionary of words used in professional Scrabble
tournaments. Each line in the file contains a single word.

Hint: use the Python random library for picking a random word.

    word = random.sample(word_list, 1)
    return word
